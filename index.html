        <h1>Divs Ids and Classes</h1>

        <h3><u>DIV</u></h3>

        <p>A div is an element with no style and no real purpose. It is used as just an open container.</p>

        <div>GO</div>

        <div>STOP</div>

        <h3><u>IDS</u></h3>

        <p>An ID allows you to target a specific element and attach CSS stylings to JUST THAT ELEMENT WITH THAT ID. In CSS, ids are targeted using the # sign. Ids can be given to ANY ELEMENT.</p>

        <div id="go">GO</div>

        <div id="stop">STOP</div>

        <p>A CLASS allows you to target a GROUP of elements, even if they are different elements. In CSS, classes are targeted using the . sign.</p>

        <h1>This is some sample text.</h1>

        <p class="bigText">This some more sample text.</p>

        <div class="bigText">This is some more text.</div>

        <p>A paragraph I don't want to change.</p>
